This document explores the fundamentals of computer networking. It covers topics such as protocols, routing, and network security. Understanding networking concepts is essential for building robust communication systems. The OSI model provides a framework for understanding network layers and their functions. TCP/IP is the most commonly used protocol suite in computer networks. Ethernet is a widely used technology for connecting devices in a local area network. Wireless networking allows devices to communicate without physical cables. Network administrators play a crucial role in managing and securing network infrastructure. Cloud networking enables scalable and flexible network resources on demand. Virtual private networks (VPNs) provide secure communication over public networks.
