Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. Threat actors, such as hackers and malware authors, target vulnerabilities in software and infrastructure to compromise systems and steal sensitive information. Security measures include firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access and detect malicious activities. Encryption techniques scramble data to make it unreadable without the correct decryption key, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Security awareness training educates users about safe computing practices and how to recognize and respond to security threats. Incident response plans outline procedures for managing and mitigating security incidents, minimizing damage and restoring normal operations. Regulatory compliance frameworks, such as GDPR and HIPAA, mandate organizations to implement security controls and protect user privacy. Ethical hacking or penetration testing assesses the security posture of systems by simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Cybersecurity professionals play a vital role in defending against cyber threats and ensuring the resilience of digital infrastructure.
