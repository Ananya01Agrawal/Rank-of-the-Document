Software engineering involves the application of engineering principles to software development. It encompasses various disciplines, including requirements engineering, software design, and testing. The software development life cycle (SDLC) outlines the stages of software development from conception to deployment. Agile methodologies emphasize iterative and incremental development, responding to change and customer feedback. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular paradigm for building modular and reusable software components. Version control systems such as Git enable collaboration and code management in software projects. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) automate the process of integrating and deploying code changes. Quality assurance ensures that software meets specified requirements and standards. DevOps practices aim to improve collaboration between development and operations teams for faster and more reliable software delivery. Software maintenance involves updating and enhancing existing software to meet evolving needs and address issues.
