Renewable energy is derived from natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, and water. Solar energy harnesses sunlight using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal collectors to generate electricity or heat water. Wind power utilizes the kinetic energy of moving air to drive turbines and produce electricity. Hydropower exploits the gravitational force of flowing water to generate electricity through dams or tidal turbines. Biomass energy involves converting organic materials such as wood, crop residues, and municipal waste into biofuels or biogas through processes like combustion or anaerobic digestion. Geothermal energy taps into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity or provide heating and cooling. Renewable energy technologies offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Energy storage solutions such as batteries and pumped hydroelectric storage enhance the reliability and flexibility of renewable energy systems. Policy support and incentives promote the adoption of renewable energy and accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.
